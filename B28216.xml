            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A POEM On the late Happy VICTORY OVER THE TURKS.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>HAD We a Muse successful as thy Sword,</l>
               <l>Thy Deeds <hi>Lorrain,</hi> should have their just Record:</l>
               <l>Thy Fame an everlasting Date should keep,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Aeneid</hi> fall, and <hi>Homers</hi> Fable sleep.</l>
               <l>Thy Fame past Ages Glory has engross'd,</l>
               <l>Thou Second Leader of a Sacred Host.</l>
               <l>'Twas great the promis'd <hi>Canaan</hi> to obtain;</l>
               <l>'Twas great to Win, but greater to Regain.</l>
               <l>Run faster, <hi>Drave,</hi> with <hi>Turkish</hi> Gore suppli'd,</l>
               <l>And to the <hi>Euxine</hi> bear thy Purple Tide;</l>
               <l>Till the proud Monarch in the Sanguin Flood,</l>
               <l>Sees just Attonement made for Christian Blood.</l>
               <l>Bear the fell Tidings to his Palace Gate,</l>
               <l>And bid <hi>Byzantium</hi> look for <hi>Buda's</hi> Fate.</l>
               <l>It was too much, proud Foe, t' have kept your Post,</l>
               <l>Against th' Assault of our Imperial Host.</l>
               <l>Your waining Moon 'gainst rising Christendom,</l>
               <l>'Twas Victory then not to be ore-come;</l>
               <l>But Fated Mortals ever tempt their Doom.</l>
               <l>Their hasty Troops misconstru'd our Retreat,</l>
               <l>And follow'd Conquest to their own Defeat.</l>
               <l>This, brave <hi>Lorrain,</hi> this was thy Noblest Fight,</l>
               <l>Who like a <hi>Parthian</hi> Conquer'st in thy Flight.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Behold both Chiefs, tho with late Slaughter tir'd,</l>
               <l>Once more Encamp'd, and for new Action fir'd:</l>
               <l>But since on Each an Empire is at stake,</l>
               <l>Each checks his Flame, and waits the Foe's Attack.</l>
               <l>The famish'd Lions thus their Rage restrain,</l>
               <l>Till folded Flocks come forth into the Plain:</l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:206591:2"/>
               <l>What shou'd our Gen'ral do? the Foe immur'd</l>
               <l>With late Experience lies too well secur'd:</l>
               <l>Nor can He tempt them forth, (that Valor's just</l>
               <l>That to an open Field its Fate would Trust)</l>
               <l>Each Method will alike destructive prove,</l>
               <l>T' Assault is Vain, and fatal to Remove.</l>
               <l>Since then He may not Fight, and scorns to Fly,</l>
               <l>A seeming Flight secures his Victory.</l>
               <l>Detachments of whole Legions are withdrawn,</l>
               <l>Whose weak Remainder Lures the <hi>Ottoman.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>At certain Spoil and Conquest they aspire,</l>
               <l>But meet Resistance that half damps their Fire.</l>
               <l>The Valiant Few th' unequal shock sustain,</l>
               <l>Till their Returning Friends surround the Plain,</l>
               <l>No more the Trenches th' Entrench'd Confine,</l>
               <l>But Sallying, in the noble Slaughter join;</l>
               <l>In Vain th' Incumber'd Infidels retreat,</l>
               <l>Their Numbers now but serve to urge their Fate.</l>
               <l>By their own Troops their Infantry's ore-run,</l>
               <l>And both by their close-pressing Foes undone.</l>
               <l>So▪ when the Waves retir'd, th' <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bands,</l>
               <l>Advanc't presumptuous on th' uncover'd Sands,</l>
               <l>Till for Escape too late, too far from Coast,</l>
               <l>The swift surrounding Waves —</l>
               <l>Return'd and swallow'd the Blaspheming Host.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where now was <hi>Britains</hi> Young and rising Star,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Caesario,</hi> fair as Peace yet form'd for War;</l>
               <l>By <hi>Caesar</hi> sent to honorable Toil,</l>
               <l>To reap Renown, while others Hunt for spoil;</l>
               <l>What Fate, what Charm the noble Youth withheld,</l>
               <l>From sharing the first Wreaths of this illustrious Field?</l>
               <l>An Envious Sickness intercepts his Course,</l>
               <l>Disarms those Hands that Brav'd the <hi>Sultan's</hi> Force.</l>
               <l>While Fate, in Plea of this diverted Fame,</l>
               <l>Cry's <hi>BƲDA</hi> has already Crown'd his Name.</l>
               <l>Nor <hi>Britains</hi> Noble Brood was wanting There,</l>
               <l>The foremost Dangers, foremost Fame to Share;</l>
               <l>Who through the World this Character have past,</l>
               <l>(How 'ere the Fields Success by Fate is cast,)</l>
               <l>The First in On-sett, in Retreat the Last.</l>
               <l>'Twas Doom'd, when <hi>Caesar, Britains</hi> Sun, should Rise,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Turkish</hi> Moon must Sett, her Crescent Dyes.</l>
